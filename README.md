# Digest Fusion Hashing (DFH)

---

## 🔒 About

**Digest Fusion Hashing (DFH)** is a data integrity reinforcement technique that combines two cryptographic digests using a random and unpredictable split ratio, generating a final hash that is highly resistant to preimage, collision, and data manipulation attacks.

This project was developed to be **simple, solid, and secure**, providing an additional layer of protection for systems that require strong data integrity guarantees.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The content and the signature are individually hashed using SHA-3-512.
2. A random split ratio between 30% and 70% is generated.
3. The two digests are merged based on the random split.
4. A final hash is generated by applying SHA-3-512 to the fused data.

This method ensures the final digest depends on:
- The original content
- The original signature
- The secret, random split ratio

## 🛠 Example Usage

```python
from dfh import DigestFusionHasher
import json

# Example data
content = b"Critical system data to be protected."
signature = b"Internal system signature or secret."

# Initialize DFH
dfh = DigestFusionHasher()

# Generate the reinforced hash
result = dfh.hash(content, signature)

# Serialize the result (for environment variables or storage)
serialized_result = json.dumps(result)

print(serialized_result)
```

✅ Output: A dictionary containing the final hash and the split ratio used.
